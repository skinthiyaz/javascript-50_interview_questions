50 JavaScript Interview Questions 🚀
A curated set of 50 JavaScript interview questions with detailed answers and code examples, focused on strengthening core JS fundamentals for frontend and full‑stack roles.
​

About this repository
This repo is designed as a study companion for JavaScript interviews, covering concepts from basics to advanced.
​

Each question is solved in a clear, practical way, with comments and example outputs where useful.
​

The structure is optimized so you can quickly revise topics like scope, closures, async JS, prototypes, and the event loop.
​

What’s included
The 50 questions are grouped by topic so you can revise section by section.

Variables, Scope & Hoisting

Data Types & Type Coercion

Functions, Closures & this

Prototypes, Classes & Inheritance

Asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, async/await)

Event Loop, Microtasks & Macrotasks

Arrays, Objects & Built‑in Methods

DOM, Events & Browser APIs (light coverage)

Many well‑known public JS question sets inspired the selection and structure of these questions.
​

Topics covered (example breakdown)
Below is an example mapping of how you can distribute your 50 questions:

Variables, Scope & Hoisting (Q1–Q8)

var vs let vs const, block scope vs function scope, Temporal Dead Zone, hoisting behavior.
​

Data Types & Type Coercion (Q9–Q14)

Primitives vs reference types, typeof, == vs ===, truthy/falsy values, implicit and explicit coercion.
​

Functions, Closures & this (Q15–Q24)

Function declarations vs expressions, arrow functions, higher‑order functions, closure examples, binding this with call, apply, bind.
​

Prototypes, Classes & OOP (Q25–Q30)

Prototype chain, __proto__ vs prototype, ES6 classes, inheritance patterns.
​

Async JS, Promises & async/await (Q31–Q38)

Callbacks, callback hell, creating and chaining promises, error handling, converting callbacks to promises, async/await patterns.
​

Event Loop & Concurrency Model (Q39–Q42)

Call stack, Web APIs, task queue vs microtask queue, order of execution with setTimeout, promises, and async/await.
​

Arrays, Objects & Built‑in Methods (Q43–Q48)

map, filter, reduce, cloning objects/arrays, shallow vs deep copy, Object.assign, spread syntax.
​

Misc / Practical Patterns (Q49–Q50)

Debouncing, throttling, currying, small utility patterns commonly asked in frontend interviews.
​

You can adjust this mapping to match your exact 50 questions.

How to use this repo
Read the question file

Start with the corresponding topic file or section for the questions you are revising.
​

Run the code sample

Copy the example code into Node, browser console, or an online playground to see outputs.
​

Experiment and modify

Change inputs, add console.log statements, and break things on purpose to understand edge cases.
​

Revision before interviews

Quickly skim the headings and key notes in each topic the day before your interview.
​

This study workflow follows patterns used in several open JavaScript interview repositories.
​

Getting started
Prerequisites
Node.js installed (any LTS version).
​

A code editor like VS Code.
​

Run examples
bash
# Example: run a JS file with Node
node your-file-name.js
You can also paste the snippets into the browser devtools console for quick testing.
​

Contribution / personal notes
Since this is your personal interview prep repo, you can treat it as a living notebook:

Add new questions as you encounter them in real interviews.
​

Update answers when you learn better explanations or new patterns.
​

Add a notes.md for tricky questions, with links to articles or docs that helped you.
